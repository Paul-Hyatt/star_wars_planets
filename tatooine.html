	<p>
		A common saying goes; "what once was golden but now decrepit, can be made golden again." The planet of Tatooine fits this narrative. Legend has it that before the birth of the now fallen Republic, Tatooine was a lush planet. Full of rainforests, oceans, and arable plains. However the planet dried up, given its distance from its suns. The planet was also further destabilized when it was discovered that the planet contained precious metallurgies. However these miners realized that they didn't want the metals anymore and quickly left Tatooine. A once powerful war lord called Jabba also roamed this planet. However, Jabba is now dead, and his once powerful minions are in need of leadership and military capability.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Empire is different, from all those corrupt warlords and miners. The Empire wont abandon the inhabitants or the planet itself! We will rebuild the ecosystem, the infastructure, and its culture. You will have the chance to restore a once glorious planet back to its former glory!

	<p>DISCLAIMER&#33; Please only apply to work on this planet if you are capable of dealing with the heat of two suns and lots of sand. Darth Vader requested the programmers add this section to the Tatooine page because he knows how tedious sand can be. Please, if you hate sand, APPLY TO A DIFFERENT PLANET.</p>
